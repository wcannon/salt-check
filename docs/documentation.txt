Initial Documentation for salt_check.py

The goal of this software is to enable easy testing of configuration managed servers.  Bluntly, the question of whether what was to be an end state of a server actually happened after setting up configuration managment software system (salt states, ansible playbook, puppet mainfest, chef recipe), and applying the software (salt, ansible, puppet, chef).

Use case: test driven configuration management, without having to program

Example process flow:
- create a test case for a server (e.g. is the right version of apache installed)
- run the test case, and see it fail
- run the config mgmt system (which installs apache)
- re-run the test case for a server and observe if the right version of apache is installed (hopefully it is)

Usage: salt '*' salt_check.run_state_tests apache
Usage: salt '*' salt_check.run_highstate_tests

Test case syntax:

UNIQUE-TEST-CASE-NAME:
  module_and_function: SALT_MODULE.FUNCTION
  args: 
    - argument1
    - argument2
  kwargs:
    - FOO=BAR
    - HELLO=HI
  assertion: assertEqual
  expected-return: COMPARE-VALUE

Definitions:
salt_module.function denotes a saltstack execution module and function to call in that module
args are arguments supported by the function
kwargs are arguments keyword arguments supported by the function
assertions are used to compare what was returned from the salt_module.function to what we expected to get
expected-return is the value we want expect to see returned from the function


Test case example:

correct-version-apache2-installed:
  module_and_function: pkg.version
  args: 
    - apache2
  kwargs: 
  pillar-data:
  assertion: assertEqual
  expected-return: 2.4.7-1ubuntu4.9

Requirements:
  SaltStack master server with ability to control target servers
  Any state to be tested should have a subdirectory of "salt-check-tests", which contains 1+ *.tst files 

Installation:
  pip install --upgrade salt_check-2016-5-1.1.tar.gz 
  
Uninstall:
  pip uninstall salt_check
