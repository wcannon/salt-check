This software is simple to use.

Basic use case:
You are using a configuration management system to manage your linux servers (possibly windows as well).  
It would be convenient to develop configuration management in a similar way to how software is developed in test driven development.
In essence the process flow ideally would be to:
- create a test for what should fail first.  
- run the test and observe it fail  
- develop the configuration management state / playbook / manifest / recipe / bash script
- run the configuration management state / playbook / manifest / recipe / bash script
- run the test and observe it pass

Requirements:
You must install a saltstack master.
The salt master must either control servers via zeromq (default) or ssh.

salt_check.py enables this to be done easily, without having to program.

Input files are simple yaml and have the following syntax:

TEST-ID:
  module_and_function:  SALT-MODULE.SALT_FUNCTION
  assertion_section: SECTION FROM OUTPUT (optional parameter)
  args: ARG-TO-FUNCTION
  kwargs: KWARGS-TO-FUNCTION
  pillar-data: PILLAR-DATA-ON-THE-FLY
  assertion: PICK-A-SUPPORTED-ASSERTION
  expected-return: VALUE-COMPARED-TO-ASSERTION
  

Here is an example which tests if a specific version of apache is installed on an ubuntu server:  
correct-version-apache2-installed:
  module_and_function: pkg.version
  args: 'apache2'
  kwargs: ''
  pillar-data: ''
  assertion: assertEqual
  expected-return: 2.4.7-1ubuntu4.9

An input file may contain multiple test cases.  
The modules and functions supported depend entirely on the version of saltstack installed.
